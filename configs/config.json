    "intro": "Hi there, this is Mayank Mohapatra — great to meet you! I’m a B.Tech undergraduate at NIT Agartala who enjoys building and securing real-world systems. I’m deeply interested in Information Security and DevOps, especially in understanding how production systems break, how to secure them, and how to make deployments faster, safer, and more reliable. I love working close to infrastructure—optimizing CI/CD pipelines, containerizing applications, and hardening cloud deployments. I’m always curious about how things work under the hood and how to make them work better.",
